# PHYS2010-F17-examples

This is a repository for sample codes that may be useful in data analysis for PHYS2010 experiments. 

* [likelihood.py](https://github.com/user/repo/PHYS2010-F17-examples/likelihood.py) calculates the best-fit parameters for
linear and power law models by minimizing the log-likelihood of a normal probability density function (PDF).

* The code is open-source, so feel free to modify, share, and improve!
